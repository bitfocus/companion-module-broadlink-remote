## Broadlink Remote

# Usage
In the module configuration enter the IP of your BroadLink RM4 Pro device (more supported devices planned). Now you can use the IR and RF
actions to learn codes (by pressing the "learn" button inside of the action) and then send out the codes.

Open the module logs for further instructions during the learning phase.
